Here was my first day of just walking around and taking photos. I definitely had a lot of fun doing so, but there are definitely some things I needed to work on here, but at least I managed to get all the shots I took developed! *I'm looking at you roll 1...*

## ðŸ“¸ Selected Shots

Why don't we start with some choice photos here before we go critiquing some of the worse off shots. A lot of these had light leakage (?) but less severe as the parts haven't actually turned to white yet?

### Harbour Strolls

> I think I left the shutter speed on this at the wrong level. I keep thinking that I should set it to match the environment I'm physically in, rather than considering the environment of what I'm shooting at. I still like how the neon comes out here.

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/2.jpg" data="roll-1" title="ICC, Sydney" %}

> I don't remember too much about the day, but it was clear skies until the afternoon when a storm was approaching. Some of these photos still look a bit washed out, or have this cool grey tone over the top of everything.

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/3.jpg" data="roll-1" title="Darling Harbour (Seagull), Sydney" %}

> Hello mate. I'm glad the seagull didn't fly off and looked at me instead, but I can't help but see that the image feels muddy in general. It's probably underexposed here.

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/4.jpg" data="roll-1" title="Darling Harbour, Sydney" %}

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/5.jpg" data="roll-1" title="Ferris wheel" %}

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/6.jpg" data="roll-1" title="Prymont Bridge, Darling Harbour" %}

> My favourite unintentionally artistic shot, the leakage splits the footpath with the water, almost if there's a divide between the warm land, and the cool sea- especially with those towering structures over to the right and the warship.

### Urban Gardens

Now this set of photos were definitely taken on an overcast day, and I set the camera's shutter speed accordinly, but after reading about colour film preferring more light than less, I could dial down the ISO and go for a slightly lower shutter speed as well.

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/a1.jpg" data="roll-2" title="Shrine gates" %}

> Not as sharp as I thought it would be, but behind the gate and under the trees would have been pretty dark.

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/a2.jpg" data="roll-2" title="Peacock" %}

> This one you can't really make out anything at all, the subject was in the shadows and I didn't adjust for that.

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/a3.jpg" data="roll-2" title="Kiss from a rose" %}

> Perhaps another favourite of mine here- I love how it brings out the red in the rose whilst the other parts of the photo just kind of blend out.

### Review

And time for some reflection on some of the other shots that didn't come out well. A lot of them revolves around having to understand what each of the shutter speed options do with this particular camera. I felt like I had them on the right settings, but they still didn't come out quite well, or they were barely visible!

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/r2.jpg" data="review" title="Small garden gate" %}

> These photos would have been taken in somewhat overcast conditions... Still kind of strange that they look so muddy. I'll have to keep an eye out for how well lit the subject is, rather than the environment on its own.

{% include lightbox.html src="20220217/02/r3.jpg" data="review" title="UTS, Building 8" %}

> Same could be said about this, it was quite bright indoors, but perhaps not bright enough for the film I was using! It's supposed to be full of reflections here.

I must say that on most of the darker shots, the left light leak is quite pronounced- I'm not too sure what it is even...
