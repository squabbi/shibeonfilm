Hello! ðŸ‘‹

You've found my blog on photography! Here I'll mostly just post pictures and reflections on those pictures, they way they look, what I wanted to see and how it was captured. 

This is going to be a place for mostly my film camera shots as that is a new ballgame for me. Come along for the ride~
